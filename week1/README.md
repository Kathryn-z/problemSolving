# Welcome to Week 1!

### Instructions

Fork this repo! (That way I don't have to give every individual permissions to
branch) Fork from the webpage in the top right corner, into your own github and
clone the repo copy from there to work on it. 

**If you aren't familiar with git, you can just download this week1 folder and
work within it**

The problems included in this section are focused on code reading, I have
provided solutions with horrific variable naming. Determine what the variables,
classes, and functions do.

### To run the programs
You can either run it in an IDE like VSCode, PyCharm, etc, or in terminal with
`python<version> <filename>`
